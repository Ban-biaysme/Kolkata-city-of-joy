              </h2>
              <p style="text-align:justify">The location of the city appears to have been originally selected partly because of its easily defensible 
                position and partly because of its favourable trading location. </p>
                <p>The low, swampy, hot, and humid riverbank 
                otherwise has little to recommend it. Its maximum elevation is about 30 feet (9 metres) above sea level. 
                Eastward from the river the land slopes away to marshes and swamplands. Similar topography on the west bank 
                of the river has confined the <em>metropolitan area</em> largely to a strip 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 km) wide on either 
                bank of the river. Reclamation of the Salt Lake area on the northeastern fringe of the city, however, 
                demonstrated that the spatial expansion of the city is feasible, 
                and further reclamation projects have been undertaken to the east, south, and west of the central area.</p>

                </h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify">More than four-fifths of the population is Hindu. Muslims and Christians constitute the largest minorities,
                   but there are some Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists. The dominant language is Bengali, but Urdu, Oriya, Tamil, 
                   Punjabi, and other languages also are spoken. Kolkata is a cosmopolitan city: other than Indians, groups 
                   present include a variety of peoples from elsewhere in Asia (notably Bangladeshis and Chinese), Europeans, 
                   North Americans, and Australians. Kolkata was segregated under British rule, the Europeans living in the city
                   centre and Indians living to the north and south. The pattern of segregation has continued in the modern city, 
                   although the distribution is now based on religious, linguistic, educational, and economic criteria. </p>

                  <p style="text-align:justify">Kolkata experienced a high rate of population growth for more than a century, and events such as the 
                    partitioning of Bengal in 1947 and warfare in Bangladesh in the early 1970s precipitated massive population 
                    influxes. 
                    Large refugee colonies also have sprung up in the northern and southern suburbs. </p>

                  <p style="text-align:justify">Given the high standards of educational and intellectual pursuits in Kolkata,
                      the city is called the cultural capital of India. The city is the birthplace of modern
                     Indian literary and artistic thought and of Indian nationalism, and its citizens have made great efforts to
                      preserve Indian culture and civilization. The blending of Eastern and Western cultural influences over the
                       centuries has stimulated the creation of numerous and diverse organizations that contribute to Kolkata’s 
                       cultural life. </p>
  
                    <p style="text-align:justify"> The esteemed poet and philosopher, and the first Nobel 
                       Laureate from India (as well as Asia), Rabindranath Tagore, and the Oscar winning film director Satyajit Ray 
                       both hail from this city. Kolkata is still the hub for music, arts, and theatre in India. Classical artists have to 
                      go through the rite of passage of performing before audience in Kolkata in order to establish themselves at
                      the national level.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Kolkata, the city of joy, is known as a place of festivals. It doesn’t matter how large or small a festival is, it is celebrated with great passion. Among several festivals, Durga Puja is the best one. The greatness is, due to
                   large-scale celebrations to the entire city. Large numbers of puja pandals appear to greet Maa Durga. </p>

                  <p style="text-align:justify"> 
                      The Festival comes in the month of October. However, the excitement and planning start two or three months
                       before its beginning. The city streets and markets are filled with a large number of people with significant
                        attention on big malls. Big Bazar, Metro shopping center, South City Shopping Mall, Vardan Market, City Center,
                         Sreeram Arcade, S S Hog Market, Axis mall are involving worth referencing. Through the four day’s occasion, 
                         the metropolis dazzles with attractive pandals and illuminative lightings.
                       Individuals from all walk of life, have fun with the festivals regardless of their neighborhood.
