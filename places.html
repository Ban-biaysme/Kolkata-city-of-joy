              think US Capitol meets Taj Mahal. Had it been built for a beautiful Indian princess rather than a colonial queen, 
              this domed beauty flanking the southern end of the Maidan would surely be considered one of India’s greatest
               buildings. Commissioned by Lord Curzon, then Viceroy of India, it was designed to 
              commemorate Queen Victoria’s demise in 1901, but construction wasn’t completed until 20 years after her death.</p>
              <p>Inside, highlights are the soaring central chamber and the Calcutta Gallery, 
                an excellent, even-handed exhibition tracing the city’s colonial-era history.</p>

Founded in 1786, the gardens – home to more than 12,000 plant species – played an important role in cultivating tea bushes smuggled in from China by the British, long before the drink became a household commodity. Today, there’s a cactus house, 
              palm collection, river-overlook and a boating lake with splendid Giant Water Lily pads.</p>

               look like a cathedral, Indian palace and Istanbul’s Aya Sofya all at the same time. Several smaller shrines
               near the Hooghly riverbank include the Sri Sarada Devi Temple, entombing the spiritual leader's wife, Sarada.</p>

                 (notably the lavishly carved 2nd-century-BC Bharhut Gateway), Egyptian mummies, relics from the ancient Indus
                  Valley civilisation of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, pickled human embryos,
                 dangling whale skeletons and some 37 types of opium in the library-like commercial botany gallery.</p>

                    One of the landmark streets of Kolkata, the Park Street is officially called Mother Teresa Sarani. As the street ran through a deer park in the early days, it was named Park Street. However, it was later re-named as Mother Theresa Sarani by Kolkata Municipal Corporation in honour of Mother Teresa.
                    One of the most happening places of Kolakata, it is also called the food street and the street that never sleeps. The road originates from Chowringhee Road (J L Nehru Road) and joins the Park Circus 7 point crossing.
                    Park Street has many notable buildings and showrooms like Asiatic Society, St. Xavier's College, Seventh-day Adventist Church and the South Park Street Cemetery.

                    A visit to Kolkata is incomplete without visiting the Park Street. Anyone visiting the city

                  <p class="mb-0" style="text-align:justify">World’s fourth busiest Cantilever bridge is situated on the River Hooghly 
                    and connects the western bank of Kolkata to the eastern bank of Howrah. This bridge acts as the lifeline of Kolkata 
                    city and offers its best view from the centre of the river, although photography is restricted here.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0" style="text-align:justify">
                      This bridge, which handles a regular traffic of roughly 60,000 vehicles and uncountable pedestrians, is now 
                      popularly called Rabindra Setu after Rabindranath Tagore. In 1939, the construction of this bridge began, 
                      owing to the communication problem between Howrah and the-then three villages of Sutanuti, Kolkata and Gobindopur. With time, 
                      Howrah emerged to be the largest railway station in West Bengal and the centre of the metropolitan 
                      city of Kolkata.</p>
                      <p class="mb-0" style="text-align:justify">
                          Moreover, it was put up at the time of the 2nd World War to allow access for the Allied powers to the Burmese 
                          front. Previously there was a pontoon bridge constructed by Sir Bradford Leslie in 1874. This structure was 
                          redesigned and made into the Howrah Bridge in 1942, which was opened to the public for use since February 1943.
                           An approximate figure of Rs. 333 crore was invested to create the strong structure of Howrah Bridge..</p>
